## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. **Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/postdoc.git
cd postdoc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Set up OpenAI API Key**

POSTDOC relies on OpenAI's API.  
Create a `.env` file in the repo root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Or export via terminal:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. **Run the Wizard!**

#### **Interactive Mode**

```bash
python postdoc.py
```

You'll be prompted step-by-step to:

- Choose your code directory or file
- Select output directory
- Pick which docs you want (README, API docs, Tutorial, and more!)
- Add custom instructions (optional)
- Choose your favorite OpenAI model
- Save these settings for next time!

#### **Config Mode**

Save your settings to `config.yaml` (can be created interactively):

```yaml
code_path: ./my_project
output_dir: ./my_project/docs
doc_types:
  - Readme
  - API documentation
  - Quickstart guide
model: gpt-4.1
custom_instructions: "Add plenty of examples and keep a friendly tone!"
```

Then run:

```bash
python postdoc.py --config config.yaml
```

#### **What languages are supported?**

Out of the box: `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`, `.go`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cs`

Absolutely! Just edit the list in `prompt_user()` for instant new options.
